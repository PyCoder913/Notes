## 🧠 Purpose

This repository is a living archive of my mathematical explorations, developed through coursework, self-study, and discussions with peers and professors. Mostly, the emphasis of each document is on definitions, theorems, proofs, and examples.

### ✅ [Fourier Analysis](./Decoding_Fourier_Analysis.pdf)  
A comprehensive reference handbook, based on Prof. Venku Naidu D’s Spring 2025 lectures at IIT Hyderabad. Covers periodic and non-periodic Fourier analysis, and periodic and non-periodic distribution theory. We study several transformations on functions, such as translations, modulations, convolutions, derivatives, and so on, and see how the Fourier transform acts on them.
